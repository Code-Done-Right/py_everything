> **NOTE:** The Python Packages listed below are must have. Anaconda3, Git Bash, etc. are not neccessary but is preffered to be installed. They may not be required directly, but they help, identify issues and in debugging. Visual Studio Code is recommended to use since it has a lot of potential tools built-in, such as a Debugger, Integrated Terminal, Git and GitHub Integrations, etc. And the extensions are very much optional. But few are required. Such as TODO Highlight is used in the code. Having it would help, but it is not mandatory.
